# AI-based-Fake-News-Detector
This repository contains an AI-based Fake News Detection System that classifies news articles as Fake or Real using Naïve Bayes Classifier based on Bayes' Theorem. The model is trained using TF-IDF vectorization and can be deployed for real-time detection.

📌 Features
Dataset: Uses the Fake & Real News Dataset from Kaggle
Algorithm: Naïve Bayes (Bayes' Theorem)
Libraries Used: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
Model Deployment: Save & Load model using Pickle.

📂 Dataset

The dataset consists of real and fake news articles, with labeled categories:
fake.csv: Contains fake news articles.
true.csv: Contains real news articles.

To download the dataset directly from Kaggle, use:
!pip install kaggle
!mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
!echo '{"username":"YOUR_USERNAME","key":"YOUR_API_KEY"}' > ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
!kaggle datasets download -d clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset --unzip

🚀 Installation & Usage
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Fake-News-Detector.git
cd Fake-News-Detector

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Train the Model
python train.py

4️⃣ Test the Model
python test.py

5️⃣ Save & Load the Model
import pickle

# Save Model
with open("fake_news_model.pkl", "wb") as model_file:
    pickle.dump(model, model_file)

# Load Model
with open("fake_news_model.pkl", "rb") as model_file:
    loaded_model = pickle.load(model_file)

📊 Data Visualization

To visualize the dataset, use the following code:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
df_fake = pd.read_csv("Fake.csv")
df_real = pd.read_csv("True.csv")

# Data distribution
plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
sns.countplot(y=["Fake"]*len(df_fake) + ["Real"]*len(df_real))
plt.title("Fake vs Real News Distribution")
plt.show()
